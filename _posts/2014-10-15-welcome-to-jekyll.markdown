Currently we are working on our first Jekyll project, and I am feeling somewhat overwheled. At this juncture I believe I may have bitten off a piece that is a little too big for me to chew.

First, I have set my site up to completely replace the standard navigation with my own design. I know this will involve creating my own layouts and includes, but I have yet to understand how this will work properly.

Furthermore, I have struggled a bit with the directory structures and how they interact with each other. To become efficient at creting customized pages and build themes or skins. I feel I will need a much clearer understanding of the file organization.

I will also need to have a better understanding of markdown, so I can create clean pages that play well within the framework of Jekyll.

Finally, as of my initial push to [Github](https://github.com/gregkorte/gregkorte.github.io) I am unable to view my work, and though I am still learning, it is a bit frustrating.

All in all I am enjoying this project, and I feel confident that I can understand the more intricate parts of Jekyll so long as I can remember to take these new concepts in bite-sized pieces.
