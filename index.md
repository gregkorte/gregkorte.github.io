<p>Hi! My name is Greg Korte, and I have been designing and maintaining websites as a hobby since 2000. Recently, however, I have decided to learn how to design professionally. I am currently a student at the Nashville Software School, and I am looking forward to improving my design knowledge and programming skills and implementing those skills in the near future.</p>
