	<td><p>My capstone project was completed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, AngularJS, C#, Asp.Net MVC, and SQL Server. This app was built fr my brother-in-law who owns and operates a pool service company in Nashville. He wanted and application that would allow him to invoice on the fly with his iPad. We figued this app will save his wife 40-60 hours per year for billing.</p></td>
